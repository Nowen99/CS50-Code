# CS50 Projects Repository

CS50 is Harvard University's introductory computer science course, widely recognized for its rigorous yet accessible approach to teaching foundational programming and problem-solving skills. For me, CS50 was incredibly useful in developing my tech career, providing a strong foundation in computer science principles and practical programming experience. The course's emphasis on real-world projects and critical thinking helped me build a robust understanding of various programming languages and technologies, fostering both technical proficiency and confidence. This comprehensive education enabled me to tackle complex tech challenges, making me a more capable and versatile professional in the tech industry.

Links to each completed problem set are posted below, and the C files within the repository are my solutions to these problem sets.
